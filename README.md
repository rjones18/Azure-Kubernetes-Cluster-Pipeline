# Azure-Kubernetes-Cluster-Pipeline


In this project, I've successfully orchestrated a Kubernetes cluster, leveraging Microsoft Azure's robust infrastructure to configure three virtual machines: one master node and two worker nodes. Enhancing the reliability of the project, Azure Pipelines is integrated for the automated deployment of Terraform IAC for the creation of the Virtual Machines and there dependencies. Additionally, three custom bash scripts were crafted to automate the initial configuration of each VM, laying the groundwork for a seamless cluster formation. Security is fortified with the inclusion of Snyk and Defender for DevOps providing vigilant vulnerability monitoring and maintaining the cluster's defenses against emerging threats.
